# Current Issues: 


1. Huggingface InferenceClient does not support local execution 
  * Therefore I could either create an account and use their infra or 
  * I could build my own wrapper for the support. 


^^^ For now, I am going with the first option

# Cost: 

So far my general costs are: 
* M4 Max 128G --> 5k
* HF Entrprise --> 216 (billed yearly at 18 a month )
* Claude Pro --> 20 bucks a month 
* OpenAI Businsess --> 600 for a year.
